## Back in the day
Gonna talk about things that no long is conected with the present

- I have been eating at this restaurant since i was a little boy
- I used to eat at this restaurant when i was a little boy

### Used to + verb infinitive
To talk about past habits or past states
In a sentence is no longer true or no longer happens
Something that doesn't affect the person anymore
- I used to drink a lot of coffee
- I didn't use to feel this way
- Did you wear a school uniform back in the day?

### Used to + verb gerund(ing)
To talk about something you are accustomed to
- I'm used to getting up early every day
- I'm not used to being interrupted by applause

### Would = used to?
Would + verb infinitive instead of "used to" to talk about past habits is very common and they almost always mean the same.
However, "would" is a little bit more nostalgic and it emphasizes how often this would happen in the past, 
Also, when we feel the need to mention the time, it is preferable to use would
- I would stay at my grandmas farm every summer
	- I used to stay at my grandmas farm when i was younger - less specific
- I used to play the guitar when i was younger
	- I would practice wvery afternoon.


### Get used to
The idea is that one will become accustomed to something - meaning,
When something changes from not being normal to being normal.
- Don't worry! You'll get used to it in no time!
