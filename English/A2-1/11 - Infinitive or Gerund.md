Both can be used as the subject or the complement of a setence
However, as subjects or complements, gerunds usually sound more like normal, spoken English, whereas infinitives sound more abstract
Infinitives emphasize the possibility or potencial for something and sounds more philosophical.
If this sounds confusing, just remeber that 90% of the time, you will use a gerund as the subject or complement of a setence.
